# Bill Training - Lite PKHeX Online
This web app helps you train your Pokémon.

Just upload your dumped PK9, then you can:

- Check pokémon nickname and OT
- Change ability
- Change override nature (as with mints)
- Change override teratype (as with shards)
- Edit IVs
- Hyper train IVs (make sure your pokémon is at least lvl 50, since I didn't add any legality check yet for this specific feature)
- Edit EVs

Then export your trained PK9 file.
